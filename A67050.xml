            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A WORD of ADVICE TO THE AUTHOR OF THAT Scurrilous and Seditious LIBEL, ENTITULED, <hi>No Proteſtant-Plot,</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe Author of that Seditious Libel called <hi>No Proteſtant-Plot,</hi> in it preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to perſwade the World into a belief that he is a man deſirous of God's Honour, and of the Safety of the King; a Zealotour for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> (though an Abhorrer of <hi>Biſhops;</hi>) a Lover of his King, and the preſent Government; yet in the ſame Libel he arraigns the one, and rails at the other, (a Crime not to be thought of, without horrour and aſtoniſhment;) but ſince he cannot be ſo ignorant and void of reaſon, as to think that any man that ever read the Libel, (except a <hi>Phanatick</hi>) can believe any ſuch Deſire, Zeal or Love can be found in, or with him, that endeavoured ſo much to corrupt and poyſon His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Subjects. It may not therefore ſeem ſtrange unto him, much leſs offenſive, (if a <hi>Proteſtant</hi>) that a <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Loyal Proteſtant</hi> do put his helping hand, to ſhew this <hi>Phanatical Libeller,</hi> not only the great malice of his zealous Enterprize, but alſo the way that may lead him to a better light, more Love and Loyalty to his King, more Reverence and Obedience to his Miniſters and Government; For as between the Flint and Steel, being ſtricken together, Fire doth fly our, ſo Judgments and Wits contending, the light of right Knowledge and <hi>Loyalty</hi> muſt needs appear; ſuch light once appearing, Truth, Falſhood and Hypocriſie, either of them, is ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>Now this Godly Author, in his Seditious Libel, has taken great pains, uſed no Art, but <hi>Phanatical;</hi> no Rhetorick, but <hi>Puritannical;</hi> multiplied Allegations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number, hunted after Common Fame beyond all Modeſty, and entred into digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, not caring how or what; all not only to make a ſhew of Learning, but hoping thereby to corrupt, alienate and prepare the Peoples Hearts for a ſecond Rebellion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93570:2"/>againſt our moſt Gracious King, (who in his Clemency and great Mercy (with all due ſubmiſſion to him) was, and is too favourable to all <hi>Phanatical Libellers,</hi> as well as <hi>Phanatical Preachers;</hi>) and alſo to diſgrace and weaken the Credit of the King's preſent Witneſſes, and to deter others from appearing, with and by the moſt improb<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble, moſt notorious and falſe occaſions, hatched and framed by the ungrateful Dr. <hi>TO.</hi> (and no Scholar) and alſo (to give you your own Phraſe) by that beggerly <hi>Iriſh</hi> Raſcal, and great Villain, <hi>E. E.</hi> which will be ſufficiently proved (to his own knowledge and confuſion) by ſome of the Greateſt, and beſt Quality in <hi>England:</hi> How well, by what Art and Puritannical ſleight this <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tiege begged his Bread ſince his coming into <hi>England,</hi> I need not inform the Libeller, nor his Party, who very well know it, to their Coſt) as well as before among other Beggers in <hi>Paris,</hi> at the Back-doors of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Colledges and Nunneries, with his Earthen Pipkin, begging for a little ſup and ſome few Scraps for a Poor Scholar, (and a Gentleman) who was baniſhed his Countrey for his Religion. The Libeller (whether it was out of diſreſpect to theſe two notorious Falſe Accuſers <hi>O.</hi> and <hi>E. E.</hi> or Ignorance in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I know not) throughout his whole Libel made uſe of <hi>Bilingſgate</hi> Language only; a Language I remember not that any other Writer, except <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> and ſuch like ungodly people, ever uſed before.</p>
            <p>In this Zealous and Phanatical Enterprize the Libeller ſeems to take great pleaſure, of it to make great Vaunts, by it to win the Credit and Perſwaſion, not only of the E. of <hi>S.</hi> but of all men, (I mean all Diſloyal men:) On the contrary, (I ſay) it's ſufficient alone, if truly and impartially conſidered, and commented upon, not only to diſcredit his <hi>Perſon,</hi> but confound his <hi>Party,</hi> and tell the World they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be at the old Game of <hi>Forty</hi> and <hi>Forty One</hi> again: What can then remain, but that this Libeller is not to be credited, nor his <hi>Factious Party</hi> to be tollerated? and why? Becauſe the Execrable and Infamous memory of the Uſurpation, Tyranny, Barbarity of the <hi>Phanatical Party</hi> (or, If you will, of our late <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi>) is daily renewed, in one Libel or other) by our preſent <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> beſides what the Libel <hi>No Proteſtant Plot</hi> contains, though it ſelf is ſufficient to ſtrike the Reader with Indignation, and horrour of the whole Sect, it being ſtuffed with Lyes, Threatenings, and incongruous falſe Notions and Stories: He therefore muſt needs be a man of very ſlender obſervation and experience in the World, who is not aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as well as ſurprized and ſtartled, at the unparallell'd Impudence and grand Villany of this Libeller and his whole Party; for there ſcarce paſſes a day without a Libel againſt either King, Church or Government; which evidently ſhews their wicked Deſigns, and confirms all men of Piety and Loyalty, that this Libeller and his Party make it their only buſineſs to raiſe a partition between the King and his People, and alſo to deprive them of their chiefeſt Comfort, and Earthly Felicity, <hi>The gracious Favour, and good Opinion of their King,</hi> and ſo create unto all Loyal People a Hell upon Earth, and bring the whole Kingdom a ſecond time into a Confuſion, under the colour of Religion, Fears of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government.</hi> Were not theſe the pretended Complaints and Grievances of the old time? Yes, and this day alſo: We may then juſtly, and without blame, ſuſpect theſe our preſent <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> who (like <hi>Samſon</hi>'s Foxes) are tied together by the Tail of Sedition, aim at no leſs Villany and Deſtruction than their Predeceſſors have acted, to their eternal ſhame and reproach, as well as to their Followers, who (like undermining Engineers) pretend to joyn with the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt Popery; But this ſpetious and Phanatical Pretenſion, which proceeds only from a Fermentation of the old Leaven, (my Friends) will not take with any that is converſant with Hiſtory, where your common Doctrine, Principles and Practice are demonſtrated to be as pernicious, if not far more deſtructive to Monarchical Government, than the moſt deſperate Principles of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> I may juſtly ſay to the Libeller and his <hi>Party</hi> what the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93570:2"/>Prophet ſaid, <hi>Accurſed be them that call Evil Good, and Good Evil;</hi> (Iſa. 5.) <hi>who call Truth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth, and perſwade <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth for Truth:</hi> And alſo take him to be one of them which the Apoſtle ſaith ſhall come in the latter days, <hi>uttering Lyes in Hypocriſie.</hi> 1 Tim. 4. For what greater Hypocriſie is there, then to charge Untruths, and to impugn the Truth with the colour of Truth, (the only thing that promoted and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the laſt Rebellion) as the Libeller doth; He is then certainly one of them whom the Prophet deſcribeth, ſaying, <hi>We have put our Confidence in Lying, and Lyes have been our ſafe-guard.</hi> This ſaying of the holy Prophet may alſo well be attributed to a certain Doctor of Phyſick, (a Relation as I ſuppoſe of the Libeller, at leaſt in Religion, and in Accuſing alike) who lately appeared in publick, (with an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friend of his now) and there gave a Pill, which he formerly with aſſeverations ſaid he never knew of, nor could compoſe it, much leſs ever gave any ſuch Pill to <hi>A. B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I ſhould here put you in mind particularly of all the Crimes and Lyes which I noted in your Libel, what Crime or Lye is there of an honeſt, diſcreet and upright Loyal Writer and Subject, that you have not incurred, and either ignorantly or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully committed, both againſt your King, Common Juſtice, and Chriſtian Charity: Your over-ſights touching <hi>Oates</hi>'s proſecuting Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> are many and malitious, and your belief as large and as malignant as of the greateſt Villain that ever ſucked <hi>Phanatick Principles;</hi> all which in due time will ſufficiently appear, to your eternal ſhame, and <hi>Oates</hi>'s grand Confuſion, being ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and as void of Grace as Learning, (if not in Plotting, and ſpeaking <hi>Lyes in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie;</hi>) But you (Libeller) I confeſs have a <hi>Phanatical</hi> ſleight in multiplying your Allegations, and furniſhing your Libel with moſt falſe Accuſations, and the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable Stories, not caring how, or what, or where you had them, ſo that ſo many ſheets of Paper were but ſtuffed up with any ſort of traſh, and Diſloyal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, an action becoming a <hi>Phanatick,</hi> and a Call for ſilly Birds, who offer at any Bait, but ſee not the Hook of Falſhood and Untruth, wherewith you Choke and Murder them, as your Predeceſſors did the beſt of Kings. But now, the Vizard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plucked off, what Ignorance can you pretend, or what colour of Excuſe can you deviſe, when called upon to the Bar of Juſtice, for your Scandalous and Seditious Libel, (omitting your other lewd and diſloyal Practices,) I am as yet to learn.</p>
            <p>Your manner of writing is beſides all this ſo diſſolute, looſe and Diſloyal, that in many places you are found contrary to your ſelf; ſometimes in plain terms to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute your ſelf, at other times, by the malicious force of your own reaſoning, to write meer Contradictions; For a view of particular Examples in each one of theſe faults, I remit you to a review of your own Libel, it being but narrow; and to our Law-Books, which you pretend to know and underſtand.</p>
            <p>The manner of your reaſoning is ſo beſide all Reaſon, and ſo far from Loyalty and Truth, which you ſo much pretend to, that from thence the moſt illiterate (if Loyal) may juſtly, and without any inferenee, infer a number of of lewd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal Conſequences, which by the force of your diſloyal and corrupted Heart and malicious Inclination, muſt needs be concluded, no leſs malignant and diſloyal than thoſe which your Predeceſſors hatched and framed, for the promotion of the laſt Rebellion: Notwithſtanding, I grant that thoſe which are to be found in your Libel, are rightly yours, and of your make in good earneſt.</p>
            <p>Now, what ſhall I call that in you, groſs Ignorance, or wilful Malice, when you moſt notoriouſly, and with unheard Impudence, endeavoured to ſlander His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties moſt Honourable and moſt Loyal Subjects, the E. <hi>H.</hi> L. <hi>H.</hi> Sir <hi>L. J.</hi> and Mr. <hi>S.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93570:3"/>
            <p>This your lewd and diſloyal dealing, your open and manifeſt ill corrupted Deſign in ſcoring and charging of untruths upon ſuch Loyal (nay to uſe your own Phraſe, the beſt of Majeſties) Subjects, cannot (I appeal to your own Conſcience) proceed of any Zeal to Truth, or Love either to King or Government, no more than the appearing of a certain Doctor of Phyſick at Court out of meer <hi>Loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You <hi>(Libeller)</hi> have alſo reflected on that Worthy and approved Loyal Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Sir <hi>G. J.</hi> for ſaying that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was a Learned man; which I dare affirm, and promiſe, that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> is ready, willing and deſirous to diſcourſe any <hi>Phanatick</hi> in any point of Learning, and eſpecially that <hi>Phanatick</hi> whom you pretend to have written his Book. But admit he were not; hath your your obſerving Sir <hi>G. G.</hi> ſaying ſo, and mentioning his Name with deriſion in your Libel, on your part, any colour or appearance of love or zeal for the Truth, or for King and Government, which all the World ſeeth not? And you did it not only to leſſen the Reputation of Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> (to whom you dare not mention one angry word face to face) whom you and all <hi>Phanaticks</hi> formerly adored, but to deface and to leſſen Sir <hi>G. G.</hi> whom otherwiſe you, nor all the <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> can with any force of good Reaſon, any Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Truth or Probability, leſſen either his Credit, natural or acquired Parts, much leſs his Loyalty; for which, as it is too apparent, and believed by the beſt of men, you all <hi>Phanaticks</hi> abhor him.</p>
            <p>In this your ſingular device of ſcoring up falſe Accuſations and Reflections upon the Kings beſt and Loyal Subjects, you are no way come ſhort, much leſs inferiour in Villany and Malice to the worſt of men; You therefore that thus ſo many ways have betrayed your ill corrupted inclinations, and diſloyal Heart, intending to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and poyſon the Hearts of His Majeſty's People, to blemiſh not only great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, and the King's Witneſſes, but the King Himſelf, and that with unheard Impudence, and with no leſs Crime then Subornation. I cannot but ſay to you, and of you, what was once ſaid in the great Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> to a diſſolute and riotous young man, declaring moſt bitterly againſt Vertue and Juſtice: <hi>Quis te ferat cenan. tem ut</hi> Craſſus, <hi>Aedificantem ut</hi> Lucullus, <hi>loquentem ut</hi> Cato. That is. Who can abide thee, to laviſh in ſumptuous Building, as <hi>Lucullus,</hi> to riot in Banquetting, as <hi>Craſsus,</hi> and yet to talk as bitterly as another <hi>Cato;</hi> which he certainly deſerved for his great diſreſpect, extreme diſſimulation and wretched hypocriſie: So deſerve you <hi>(Libeller)</hi> in the eſtimation of all Loyal men, to be taken not only for a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler, and a Hypocrite, but alſo for the moſt diſloyal of mankind, and therefore not to be abided.</p>
            <p>I conclude, and pray you to remember, that fault-finders ought of all right to be faultleſs; and that Accuſers ſhould always be blameleſs. Remember alſo the Holy Scripture, that ſpeaketh thus unto you: <hi>Thou Hypocrite, caſt firſt the Beam out of thine own eye, and then thou ſhalt ſee to pick out the Mote of thy Brothers Eye,</hi> Matth. 7.</p>
            <p>Having thus laid open before you your many and great Villanies, and diſloyal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, hoping that you will alter and amend what is amiſs; which I heartily wiſh, and only pray you will afix your Name to the Libel called <hi>No Proteſtant-Plot,</hi> and your Friend will afix his to an Anſwer.</p>
